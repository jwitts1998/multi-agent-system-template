# Documentation Editing Rules

When editing README.md, SETUP_GUIDE.md, PROJECT_QUESTIONNAIRE.md, INSTALLATION.md, QUICK_START.md, or files under `docs/`:

- Follow the existing section structure (headings, tables, code blocks, list style). Add new content in the appropriate existing section or clearly delineated new section.
- Keep tone and formatting consistent with the rest of the document.
- Do not remove or rename documented `{{VARIABLES}}` from variable reference tables.
- When adding new template files or directories, update the file structure diagram in README.md and any relevant copy commands in SETUP_GUIDE.md.
- Keep examples in `examples/` aligned with the current template variable lists and file paths.
