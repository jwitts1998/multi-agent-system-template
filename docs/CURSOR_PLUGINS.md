# Cursor Plugins and Integrations

**Last Updated**: February 2026

## Overview

Cursor marketplace plugins extend what agents can do by adding **agent skills** and **MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools**. When a plugin is installed, its capabilities become available to all agents automatically — agents will use them when relevant to the task at hand.

This document lists the plugins and capabilities currently available in this workspace. Keep it up to date when you install or remove plugins so that agents and documentation stay aligned.

## MCP Servers

MCP servers provide tool-level integrations that agents call directly.

| Server | Capabilities |
|--------|-------------|
| **cursor-ide-browser** | Browser automation — navigate pages, take snapshots, click elements, fill forms, type text, take screenshots. Useful for frontend testing and web interaction. |
| **Context7** | Fetch up-to-date documentation and code examples for any library or framework. Resolve a library ID, then query its docs. |

## Gap Identification

Agents should actively identify when installing a plugin, creating a custom skill, or exposing an MCP server would improve development quality or velocity. Use these guidelines:

### When to Install an Existing Plugin

- The project uses a framework, service, or tool (e.g., Stripe, Supabase, Figma, a specific testing framework) that has a Cursor marketplace plugin but it is not listed above
- Agents are performing tasks manually that a plugin automates — accessibility scanning, visual regression testing, docs lookup, cross-browser testing, design-to-code translation
- A new dependency or integration has been added to the project and a corresponding plugin exists

### When to Create a Custom Skill

- A multi-step workflow is repeated across tasks (e.g., a specific deployment sequence, data migration pattern, code generation recipe) and would benefit from codification
- Project-specific domain knowledge — naming conventions, validation rules, architecture decisions, code patterns — is being re-derived each session instead of encoded once
- Agents make the same mistakes repeatedly because conventions are not persisted in a skill
- Use the `create-skill` workflow skill to author new skills with proper structure

### When to Expose an MCP Server

- Agents frequently shell out to a project CLI, database client, or internal API — structured MCP access would be safer and more efficient
- Multiple agents need the same tool access and each builds ad-hoc shell commands independently
- The project has tools that would benefit from structured input/output rather than raw terminal interaction

### After Installing or Creating

Update this file (`docs/CURSOR_PLUGINS.md`) with the new capability so all agents are aware. Add entries to the appropriate section above (MCP Servers, Skills by Area) with a brief description of what it does.

## Maintaining This List

**When you install a new plugin**: Add its skills and/or MCP tools to the appropriate section above. You can see what a plugin provides by checking the skills and tools that appear in your Cursor session after installation.

**When you remove a plugin**: Delete its entries from this list so agents don't reference unavailable capabilities.

**Project-specific customization**: Remove entries for plugins you don't use (e.g., remove Stripe skills if you don't process payments, remove Figma skills if you don't use Figma for design). This keeps agent context focused on what's actually available.
