## 🎨 Customization Levels

### Level 1: Minimal (Variable Replacement Only)

Replace template variables with your project values.

**Time**: 15-30 minutes  
**Effort**: Low  
**When**: Standard project that fits templates well

### Level 2: Moderate (Adjust Templates)

Replace variables + modify sections to fit your architecture and patterns.

**Time**: 1-2 hours  
**Effort**: Medium  
**When**: Project with some unique patterns or requirements

### Level 3: Extensive (Heavily Customize)

Deep customization of all templates to match your specific needs.

**Time**: 3-4 hours  
**Effort**: High  
**When**: Project with unique architecture, tech stack, or requirements

## 📏 Agent Scale: Minimal vs. Full Setup

Choose how many agents and subagents to adopt based on your team size and project complexity.

| Tier | Agent Roles | Subagents | When to Use |
|------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Minimal** | Implementation + QA (2 roles) | code-reviewer + 1 specialist | Small team, simple project, getting started |
| **Standard** | All 4 base roles (Implementation, QA, Testing, Documentation) | code-reviewer, test-writer, debugger, doc-generator + 1-2 specialists | Most projects, recommended default |
| **Full** | All base + project-type roles | All generic + specialists + ingestion agents | Large team, complex platform, multi-vertical |

### Minimal Setup

Start here if you are new to the template or have a small project:

- **`AGENTS.md`**: Keep only Implementation Agent and Quality Assurance Agent
- **Subagents**: `code-reviewer` + one specialist matching your stack (e.g., `node-specialist`, `react-specialist`, `flutter-specialist`)
- **Task schema**: Use the full schema -- it works fine with fewer agents (just assign fewer `agent_roles` per task)
- **Skip**: Ingestion agents (unless importing existing code), workflow docs (add later as team grows)

### Standard Setup

Recommended for most projects once you are comfortable with the system:

- **`AGENTS.md`**: All four base roles (Implementation, QA, Testing, Documentation)
- **Subagents**: Generic set (code-reviewer, test-writer, debugger, doc-generator) + one or two specialists
- **Workflow docs**: Add `MULTI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md` and `DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md`
- **Task schema**: Full schema with `agent_roles` on every task

### Full Setup

For large teams, complex platforms, or projects that need coordination across many concerns:

- **`AGENTS.md`**: All base roles + project-type-specific roles (e.g., `database`, `security`, `api`, `frontend`)
- **Subagents**: All generic + all relevant specialists + ingestion agents
- **Coordination**: Optionally add a coordination layer (agent-router) and system agents for routing, query enrichment, and governance. See [feedback/symposium.md](../feedback/symposium.md) for an example of a full coordination layer.
- **Memory system**: Consider adding a tiered memory system for multi-session continuity. See [templates/memory/](../templates/memory/) for examples.

## 🔌 Cursor Plugins and Skills

Cursor marketplace plugins add **agent skills** and **MCP tools** that agents use automatically when relevant. A starter list of available capabilities ships with this template at [docs/CURSOR_PLUGINS.md](./CURSOR_PLUGINS.md).

### Customizing for Your Project

1. **Remove what you don't use**: If you don't process payments, delete the Stripe entries. If you don't use Figma, delete the Figma entries. Keeping the list focused prevents agents from referencing unavailable capabilities.
2. **Add what you install**: When you add a new plugin from the Cursor marketplace, add its skills and MCP tools to the appropriate section in `docs/CURSOR_PLUGINS.md`.
3. **Stack-specific entries**: The "Stack-Specific" section is a good place to add plugins that match your tech stack (e.g., Rails plugins for a Rails project, Supabase plugins if you use Supabase).

Agents reference this file to know which skills and tools are available, so keeping it current improves the quality of agent suggestions.

## 🗑️ Post-Setup Pruning Checklist

After running `./setup.sh` (or manually copying templates), remove files you don't need to keep the project clean. If you chose automatic pruning during setup, most of this is already done.

### Always Safe to Remove

These are template-library files, not project files:

| File / Directory | Why |
|-----------------|-----|
| `INSTALLATION.md` | Instructions for installing the template centrally (not needed after clone) |
| `PROJECT_QUESTIONNAIRE.md` | One-time questionnaire (already answered during setup) |
| `QUICK_START.md` | Template quick-start guide (setup is done) |
| `examples/` | Reference examples — useful to read, but not part of your project |
| `feedback/` | Template feedback system (meta, not project-level) |

### Remove Based on Project Type

After choosing your project type, delete the templates for other types:

**If you chose `mobile-app`**, remove:
- `templates/cursorrules/web-app.cursorrules`
- `templates/cursorrules/backend-service.cursorrules`
- `templates/cursorrules/full-stack.cursorrules`
- `templates/agents/AGENTS-web.md`, `AGENTS-backend.md`, `AGENTS-full-stack.md`
- `templates/subagents/specialists/react-specialist.md`, `node-specialist.md`

**If you chose `web-app`**, remove:
- `templates/cursorrules/mobile-app.cursorrules`
- `templates/cursorrules/backend-service.cursorrules`
- `templates/cursorrules/full-stack.cursorrules`
- `templates/agents/AGENTS-mobile.md`, `AGENTS-backend.md`, `AGENTS-full-stack.md`
- `templates/subagents/specialists/flutter-specialist.md`, `node-specialist.md`

**If you chose `backend-service`**, remove:
- `templates/cursorrules/mobile-app.cursorrules`
- `templates/cursorrules/web-app.cursorrules`
- `templates/cursorrules/full-stack.cursorrules`
- `templates/agents/AGENTS-mobile.md`, `AGENTS-web.md`, `AGENTS-full-stack.md`
- `templates/subagents/specialists/flutter-specialist.md`, `react-specialist.md`

**If you chose `full-stack`**, remove:
- `templates/cursorrules/mobile-app.cursorrules`
- `templates/cursorrules/web-app.cursorrules`
- `templates/cursorrules/backend-service.cursorrules`
- `templates/agents/AGENTS-mobile.md`, `AGENTS-web.md`, `AGENTS-backend.md`
- `templates/subagents/specialists/flutter-specialist.md`

### Always Keep

| File / Directory | Why |
|-----------------|-----|
| `.cursorrules` | Active project rules (at root) |
| `AGENTS.md` | Active agent definitions (at root) |
| `tasks.yml` and `tasks/` | Active task tracking |
| `.cursor/agents/` | Active subagent configs |
| `docs/` | Project documentation |
| `SETUP_GUIDE.md` | Useful reference for understanding the system |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Template version history (helpful for updates) |
| `templates/tasks/TASK_SCHEMA_GUIDE.md` | Reference for task file format |
| `validate.sh` | Variable validation (useful ongoing) |

### Optional — Remove When Confident

| File / Directory | Why you might keep it |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| `templates/` (entire directory) | Source reference for re-customizing or adding agents later |
| `setup.sh` | Re-run if you need to reconfigure |
| `templates/subagents/ingestion/` | Only needed if importing existing code later |
| `templates/memory/` | Only needed if adopting multi-session memory |

## 🔧 Component Customization

### `.cursorrules` Customization

**Required Variables**:
- `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` - Your project name
- `{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}` - One-sentence description
- `{{PRIMARY_LANGUAGE}}` - Main language
- `{{FRAMEWORK}}` - Primary framework
- `{{ARCHITECTURE_PATTERN}}` - Architecture style

**Common Customizations**:

1. **Add Project-Specific Patterns**:
```markdown
## Custom Patterns for {{PROJECT_NAME}}

### API Client Pattern
- Always use ApiClient singleton
- Wrap responses in Result<T, Error> type
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
```

2. **Add Security Requirements**:
```markdown
## Security Requirements

### API Key Management
- Use AWS Secrets Manager
- Rotate keys every 90 days
- Never log API keys
```

3. **Add Testing Standards**:
```markdown
## Testing Strategy

### Contract Testing
- Use Pact for consumer-driven contracts
- Test all API integrations
- Run contract tests in CI/CD
```

### `.cursor/rules/` Customization (Alternative Format)

Instead of (or in addition to) a single `.cursorrules` file, you can use `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files. Each `.mdc` file uses YAML frontmatter to control when it applies.

**When to prefer `.cursor/rules/`**:
- You want rules that activate only when specific file types are open (e.g., `globs: **/*.ts`)
- You prefer separate, focused rule files over a single large file
- Your team wants to discover and toggle rules via Cursor's rule picker

**How to split `.cursorrules` into `.mdc` files**:
1. Identify logical sections in your `.cursorrules` (e.g., code style, security, testing, workflow)
2. Create one `.mdc` file per section in `.cursor/rules/`
3. Add frontmatter with `description` and either `globs` (file-specific) or `alwaysApply: true` (global)
4. Move the relevant content from `.cursorrules` into each `.mdc` file

**Example frontmatter**:
```yaml
---
description: TypeScript conventions for MyProject
globs: **/*.{ts,tsx}
alwaysApply: false
---
```

Pre-made `.mdc` templates are available at `templates/cursorrules/rules/`. Copy them to your project's `.cursor/rules/` and customize.

### `AGENTS.md` Customization

**Add Custom Agent Roles**:

```markdown
### Deployment Agent
**Primary Role**: Deployment automation and release management

**Responsibilities**:
- Manage deployment pipelines
- Create release notes
- Handle rollbacks
- Monitor post-deployment

**When to Use**: Deployment tasks, release management
```

**Adjust Agent Responsibilities**:

Add project-specific items to existing agent checklists:

```markdown
### Implementation Agent Checklist
- [ ] Architecture pattern followed
- [ ] YOUR_CUSTOM_CHECK_1
- [ ] YOUR_CUSTOM_CHECK_2
```

### Task Schema Customization

**Add Custom Fields**:

```yaml
tasks:
  - id: TASK_T1
    # Standard fields
    # ... 
    # Custom fields
    estimated_hours: 8
    complexity: high
    risk_level: medium
    deployment_env: [dev, staging]
```

**Add Custom Agent Roles**:

```yaml
agent_roles:
  - implementation
  - deployment      # Custom role
  - monitoring      # Custom role
```

### Subagent Customization

**Create Custom Subagents**:

```markdown
---
name: deployment-specialist
description: Expert in CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes deployment. Use proactively for deployment tasks.
---

You are a deployment specialist for {{PROJECT_NAME}}.

## Deployment Process

1. Build Docker images
2. Run integration tests
3. Deploy to staging
4. Run smoke tests
5. Deploy to production

## Rollback Procedure

[Your rollback steps]
```

**Customize Existing Subagents**:

Add project-specific sections:

```markdown
## Special Instructions for {{PROJECT_NAME}}

- Use project's custom logging framework
- Follow naming conventions for containers
- Always tag images with git SHA
- Deploy during maintenance windows only
```

---

## 💡 Customization Examples

### Example 1: Microservices Architecture

**Changes needed**:

**.cursorrules**:
```markdown
## Architecture: Microservices

### Service Communication
- Use gRPC for inter-service communication
- Implement circuit breakers
- Use service mesh (Istio)

### Service Structure
```
project/
├── services/
│   ├── auth-service/
│   ├── user-service/
│   └── payment-service/
```
```

**AGENTS.md** - Add agents:
```markdown
### Service Integration Agent
Handles inter-service communication and API contracts.

### Infrastructure Agent
Manages Kubernetes, service mesh, and infrastructure as code.
```

### Example 2: Monorepo with Multiple Apps

**Changes needed**:

**.cursorrules**:
```markdown
## Monorepo Structure
```
project/
├── apps/
│   ├── mobile/      # React Native
│   ├── web/         # Next.js
│   └── admin/       # React
├── packages/
│   ├── shared/      # Shared code
│   └── ui/          # UI components
```

### Workspace Guidelines
- Shared code in packages/
- Each app is independent
- Shared types in packages/shared/types/
```

**AGENTS.md** - Adjust for monorepo:
```markdown
### Cross-Platform Agent
Ensures consistency across mobile, web, and admin apps.
```

## ✅ Customization Checklist

Use this checklist when adopting the template. It clarifies what must be replaced, what should be kept as-is, and what to adapt to your project.

### Always Replace (project-specific content)

- [ ] All `{{VARIABLE}}` placeholders (search for `{{` to find them)
- [ ] Project name, description, and philosophy
- [ ] Tech stack, framework, and language references
- [ ] Architecture patterns and directory structure
- [ ] Security requirements and secrets management approach
- [ ] Testing frameworks and coverage targets
- [ ] Example code snippets (replace with your stack's patterns)

### Always Keep (template structure)

- [ ] Agent role definition format (responsibilities, "When to Use", checklist sections)
- [ ] Task schema field names and status values (`todo`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `done`)
- [ ] Workflow pattern names (Sequential, Parallel, Review-Based) and handoff protocol format
- [ ] Subagent markdown format (frontmatter with `name`/`description` + sections)
- [ ] Task ID convention (`FEATURE_T{N}_{name}`)
- [ ] `spec_refs` format for linking tasks to documentation

### Customize to Fit (adapt but don't remove)

- [ ] Agent checklists -- add project-specific items, keep universal ones (e.g., "no hardcoded secrets")
- [ ] Workflow patterns -- add new patterns if needed (e.g., "Schema-First", "Infrastructure-First"), keep the base set
- [ ] Specialist subagents -- swap for your stack (e.g., replace `flutter-specialist` with `terraform-specialist`)
- [ ] Agent roles in `AGENTS.md` -- add domain-specific roles (e.g., Data Quality, Infrastructure), keep the four base roles
- [ ] Code review checklist -- add project-specific checks, keep universal ones

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

### Don't Over-Customize Initially

Start minimal, add customizations as needed.

❌ **Bad**: Spend hours adding every possible edge case upfront  
✅ **Good**: Start with variables, add custom sections as you encounter needs

### Don't Break Template Structure

Keep the structure intact, add within sections.

❌ **Bad**: Completely restructure `.cursorrules`  
✅ **Good**: Add custom sections within existing structure

### Don't Leave Variables Unfilled

Search for `{{` to find remaining variables.

❌ **Bad**: Commit files with `{{PROJECT_NAME}}`  
✅ **Good**: Replace all variables before committing

---

## 🔍 Validation

### Check Your Customizations

1. **Variable Check**: Search for `{{` - should find none
2. **Syntax Check**: Verify YAML is valid
3. **Link Check**: Verify all `spec_refs` point to real files
4. **Agent Role Check**: All `agent_roles` are defined in `AGENTS.md`

### Test Your Setup

1. **Manual Test**: Ask AI to review a file using your `.cursorrules`
2. **Agent Test**: Invoke a subagent and verify it uses project context
3. **Task Test**: Have AI select and work on a task

---

## 🚀 Advanced Patterns

### Optional: Cursor Profiles

For projects with multiple domains, verticals, or concerns, you can create **instruction profile** files in `.cursor/` that pre-load domain-specific context before a session. This narrows the AI assistant's focus to a particular area.

**Example**: A multi-vertical analytics platform might have:

```
.cursor/
├── analytics_profile.json     # Focus on analytics pipeline concerns
├── vendor_profile.json        # Focus on vendor integration concerns
└── infra_profile.json         # Focus on infrastructure concerns
```

Each profile contains key context -- relevant docs, conventions, and priorities for that domain. Reference the active profile at the start of a session (e.g., "Load the analytics profile for this session") to give the assistant targeted context.

This pattern complements the agent system: agents define *what roles exist*, while profiles define *what domain the session focuses on*. Profiles are especially useful for large codebases where loading all context at once is impractical.

**Note**: This pattern originated from project feedback. See [feedback/symposium.md](../feedback/symposium.md) for a real-world example.
