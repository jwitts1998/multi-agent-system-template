# Feedback

This folder collects feedback from projects that have applied the **Multi-Agent Development System Template**. Each submission helps improve the template for future adopters.

## How to Submit Feedback

1. **Use the paste-in prompt** (recommended): Open a Cursor (or other AI) session in your project and paste in the prompt from [PASTE_IN_PROMPT.md](./PASTE_IN_PROMPT.md). The AI will draft a feedback document using your project's template-derived files as context.
2. **Manual**: Copy [TEMPLATE.md](./TEMPLATE.md), fill it out, and save it here.

### File Naming

Save your feedback file in this folder using one of these conventions:

- `project-name.md` (e.g. `acme-api.md`)
- `YYYY-MM-project-name.md` (e.g. `2026-02-acme-api.md`)

### What to Include

- Which template components you used (agents, cursorrules, tasks, workflows, subagents, ingestion)
- What worked well
- Pain points or gaps you encountered
- Suggested improvements to templates, docs, or examples
- Template version or date if known

See [TEMPLATE.md](./TEMPLATE.md) for the full structure.
