## 🔄 Agent Collaboration Patterns

### Sequential Workflow
1. **API Agent** → Design endpoint, implement handler
2. **Database Agent** → Create schema, migration, repository
3. **Security Agent** → Add auth, input validation, rate limiting
4. **Testing Agent** → Write tests (unit, integration, security)

### Parallel Workflow
- **API Agent** → Implements endpoint A
- **Database Agent** → Optimizes queries for feature B
- **Testing Agent** → Tests feature C
- **Security Agent** → Security audit for feature D

## 📋 Role Mapping

Task files use short `agent_roles` values. This table maps each value to the role (and checklist) the agent should adopt:

| `agent_roles` value | Role to adopt | Notes |
|----------------------|---------------|-------|
| `api` | API Agent | Endpoint design, validation, request handling |
| `database` | Database Agent | Schema, migrations, query optimization |
| `testing` | Testing Agent | Unit, integration, and security tests |
| `security` | Security Agent | Auth, authorization, input sanitization |
| `implementation` | API Agent | Generic implementation — defaults to API Agent |
| `backend` | API Agent | Backend-scoped — use API Agent checklist |
| `quality_assurance` | Security Agent | Code review — apply QA lens with security checklist |
| `documentation` | API Agent | Documentation — apply docs lens to API endpoints |
| `ui_ux` | API Agent | Rarely used in backend — treat as API Agent |

If a task lists a value not in this table, treat it as API Agent.

## 📋 Task Execution Protocol

When you pick up a task with multiple `agent_roles`, follow this protocol:

1. **Read the task** — review `agent_roles`, `spec_refs`, `description`, and `acceptance_criteria`
2. **Resolve roles** — map each `agent_roles` value to a role using the Role Mapping table above
3. **Execute in order** — work through the roles in the order they are listed in `agent_roles` (default to sequential workflow order: API → Database → Security → Testing)
4. **Per role** — complete that role's checklist, then add a handoff note to the task before moving to the next role
5. **Final role** — after completing the last role's work, validate all `acceptance_criteria` and propose `status: done`
6. **Single role** — if only one role is listed, complete its checklist and propose status when done

## 🔌 Plugins and MCP Tools

Agents have access to MCP tools and skills provided by installed Cursor plugins. See `docs/CURSOR_PLUGINS.md` for the full list. Use them when relevant to the task.

**Stack-relevant examples**:
- **Context7**: Look up current docs for {{BACKEND_FRAMEWORK}}, {{ORM_LIBRARY}}, and any dependency before implementing unfamiliar APIs
- **Supabase Postgres**: Query optimization and database best practices for {{DATABASE_TYPE}}
- **Stripe**: Payment integration best practices (if applicable)
- **parallel-web-search**: Verify security practices, CVE lookups, and current OWASP guidance

Flag gaps: if agents are doing work manually that a plugin, skill, or MCP server could handle, recommend installing or creating one and update `docs/CURSOR_PLUGINS.md`.
