# Multi-Agent Development System — Starter Rules

## Project Overview

This project uses a multi-agent development system. Specialized AI agents collaborate on implementation, design, testing, and quality assurance.

**Status**: This is a freshly cloned starter. Run `./setup.sh` to configure for your specific project, which will replace this file with project-specific rules.

## How This System Works

### Agent Roles

Agents are perspectives, not separate processes. When working on a task, adopt the role specified in the task's `agent_roles` field:

- **Implementation Agent**: Write production code, follow architecture patterns, handle business logic
- **Quality Assurance Agent**: Review code for quality, security, and architecture compliance
- **Testing Agent**: Write tests, ensure coverage, validate behavior
- **Documentation Agent**: Generate and maintain documentation

### Task-Driven Development

Work is organized through task files:

- **Portfolio-level**: `tasks.yml` — milestones and high-level goals
- **Feature-level**: `tasks/*.yml` — detailed implementation tasks with `spec_refs`, `agent_roles`, and `acceptance_criteria`

### Workflow

1. Select a task with `status: todo` (prefer `priority: high`)
2. Read `spec_refs`, `description`, and `acceptance_criteria`
3. Check `agent_roles` — adopt the appropriate role
4. Implement following project conventions
5. Verify all `acceptance_criteria` are met
6. Propose `status: done` when complete

## Key Directories

```
docs/product_design/    — Product Design Blueprint (PDB)
docs/architecture/      — Architecture documentation
tasks/                  — Feature task files (tasks/*.yml)
.cursor/agents/         — Subagent configurations
```

## Standards (Generic — Will Be Replaced by setup.sh)

### Code Quality
- Functions: small, focused, < 50 lines
- Comments: explain "why", not "what"
- Follow DRY principle
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

### Security
- Never commit API keys, tokens, or credentials
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Validate all user input
- Use parameterized queries

### Testing
- Write tests alongside implementation
- Test behavior, not implementation details
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

## Available Agents

Subagent configs are in `templates/subagents/`. After running `./setup.sh`, they'll be copied to `.cursor/agents/`. Invoke with `@agent-name`.

### Ideation (for new ideas)
- `@idea-to-pdb` — Explore an idea and generate a Product Design Blueprint
- `@context-to-pdb` — Transform stakeholder context into a PDB (skip blank-slate discovery)
- `@pdb-to-tasks` — Decompose a PDB into epics and task files

### Generic (for development)
- `@code-reviewer` — Code quality, security, architecture review
- `@test-writer` — Test creation and coverage
- `@debugger` — Error investigation and fixes
- `@designer` — UI/UX, design system, accessibility
- `@doc-generator` — Documentation creation and maintenance
- `@security-auditor` — Security scanning and hardening
- `@performance-optimizer` — Performance analysis and optimization

### Ingestion (for existing codebases)
- `@codebase-auditor` — Analyze existing code structure
- `@gap-analysis` — Identify production-readiness gaps
- `@documentation-backfill` — Generate PDB from existing code

### Cursor Plugins and Skills

Agents have access to **agent skills** and **MCP tools** provided by installed Cursor plugins. Use them when relevant — for example, web search for research, Context7 for library docs, BrowserStack for cross-browser testing, Figma skills for design-to-code, and workflow skills for structured plans and code review.

See `docs/CURSOR_PLUGINS.md` for the full list of available capabilities.

## Session Checklist

Before completing any task, verify:

- [ ] Task file updated with status and notes
- [ ] Relevant documentation updated
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Agent handoff notes added (if task has multiple `agent_roles`)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria reviewed and met

---

**To configure for your project**: Run `./setup.sh` from the repo root.
