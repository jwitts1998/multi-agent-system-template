# Stakeholder Context

Use this template to structure context received from a stakeholder before passing it to `@context-to-pdb`. Filling this out is **optional** — the agent can also work from raw unstructured text pasted directly into chat.

---

## Source

- **Provided by**: [Name / role / team]
- **Date received**: [Date]
- **Format**: [Meeting notes / PRD / Slack thread / Email / Document / Verbal]
- **Confidence level**: [High — stakeholder is decisive / Medium — directional but flexible / Low — exploratory, may change]

---

## Context Chunk

Paste the stakeholder's raw content here verbatim. Preserve their exact wording — the agent will extract structured elements from this.

> [Paste stakeholder content here]

## Stakeholder Intent

What does the stakeholder want built? What outcome are they expecting?

- **Target output**: [MVP demo / Internal tool / Production product / Proof-of-concept]
- **Core ask**: [One sentence summarizing what they want]
- **Who sees the result**: [Stakeholder only / Their team / End users / Investors / Customers]

---

## Known Constraints

- **Timeline**: [When do they need to see something? Hard deadline or flexible?]
- **Budget**: [Any budget constraints? Free-tier only? Specific service limits?]
- **Tech stack**: [Any locked-in technologies? Preferred frameworks? Existing infrastructure?]
- **Regulatory**: [Any compliance requirements? HIPAA, GDPR, SOC2, etc.]
- **Other**: [Any other constraints mentioned or implied]

- [ ] [Criterion 2 — e.g., "Dashboard shows real-time data"]
- [ ] [Criterion 3 — e.g., "Works on mobile"]
- [ ] [Add more as needed]
