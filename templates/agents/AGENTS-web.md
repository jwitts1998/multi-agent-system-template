## 🔄 Agent Collaboration Patterns

### Sequential Workflow
1. **Design System Agent** → Review design, ensure design system adherence
2. **Frontend Agent** → Implement components and features
3. **Testing Agent** → Write tests (unit, component, E2E)
4. **Performance Agent** → Optimize bundle and rendering

### Parallel Workflow
- **Frontend Agent** → Implements feature A
- **Design System Agent** → Updates component library
- **Testing Agent** → Tests feature B (previously implemented)
- **Performance Agent** → Optimizes feature C

## 📋 Role Mapping

Task files use short `agent_roles` values. This table maps each value to the role (and checklist) the agent should adopt:

| `agent_roles` value | Role to adopt | Notes |
|----------------------|---------------|-------|
| `frontend` | Frontend Agent | Component development and state management |
| `design_system` | Design System Agent | UI consistency, theming, accessibility |
| `testing` | Testing Agent | Unit, component, integration, and E2E tests |
| `performance` | Performance Agent | Bundle optimization and Core Web Vitals |
| `implementation` | Frontend Agent | Generic implementation — defaults to Frontend Agent |
| `ui_ux` | Design System Agent | UI/UX focus — use Design System Agent checklist |
| `quality_assurance` | Design System Agent | Code review — apply QA lens with design review checklist |
| `documentation` | Frontend Agent | Documentation — apply docs lens to components and features |
| `security` | Frontend Agent | Security focus — apply security lens to input handling, XSS prevention |

If a task lists a value not in this table, treat it as Frontend Agent.

## 📋 Task Execution Protocol

When you pick up a task with multiple `agent_roles`, follow this protocol:

1. **Read the task** — review `agent_roles`, `spec_refs`, `description`, and `acceptance_criteria`
2. **Resolve roles** — map each `agent_roles` value to a role using the Role Mapping table above
3. **Execute in order** — work through the roles in the order they are listed in `agent_roles` (default to sequential workflow order: Design System → Frontend → Testing → Performance)
4. **Per role** — complete that role's checklist, then add a handoff note to the task before moving to the next role
5. **Final role** — after completing the last role's work, validate all `acceptance_criteria` and propose `status: done`
6. **Single role** — if only one role is listed, complete its checklist and propose status when done

## 🔌 Plugins and MCP Tools

Agents have access to MCP tools and skills provided by installed Cursor plugins. See `docs/CURSOR_PLUGINS.md` for the full list. Use them when relevant to the task.

**Stack-relevant examples**:
- **Context7**: Look up current docs for {{FRONTEND_FRAMEWORK}}, component libraries, and any dependency before implementing unfamiliar APIs
- **BrowserStack**: Cross-browser testing and WCAG accessibility scanning
- **Figma skills**: Translate Figma designs to frontend code with 1:1 visual fidelity
- **Vercel React best practices**: Performance optimization patterns (if React/Next.js)
- **parallel-web-search**: Verify best practices when introducing new patterns, libraries, or performance techniques

Flag gaps: if agents are doing work manually that a plugin, skill, or MCP server could handle, recommend installing or creating one and update `docs/CURSOR_PLUGINS.md`.
