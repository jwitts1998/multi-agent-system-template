# Task Schema Guide

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: January 2026

## 📖 Overview

This guide documents the task tracking schema used in the multi-agent development system. The schema defines two types of task files:

1. **Portfolio-level tasks** (`tasks.yml`) - High-level milestones and gaps
2. **Per-feature tasks** (`tasks/*.yml`) - Detailed implementation tasks

Both schemas support agent role assignments for multi-agent workflows.

## 🔑 Field Definitions

### Status Values

**Portfolio-level** (`milestones`):
- `completed` - Milestone finished
- `in_progress` - Currently being worked on
- `planned` - Scheduled for future

**Per-feature** (`tasks`):
- `todo` - Not started
- `in_progress` - Currently being worked on
- `blocked` - Blocked by dependencies or issues
- `done` - Completed and verified

### Priority Values

- `critical` - Urgent, blocking other work
- `high` - Important, should be done soon
- `medium` - Normal priority
- `low` - Nice to have, can be deferred

### Effort Values

Effort values apply at both portfolio-level (milestones) and per-feature (tasks) level:

**Portfolio-level** (`milestones`):
- `small` - < 1 week
- `medium` - 1-3 weeks
- `large` - > 3 weeks

**Per-feature** (`tasks`):
- `small` - Completable in a single focused session (< 1 hour of agent work)
- `medium` - Requires a dedicated session, may span multiple agent handoffs (1-4 hours)
- `large` - Spans multiple sessions, likely needs decomposition or dedicated focus (> 4 hours)

The task orchestrator uses `effort` for session planning — batching small tasks together and flagging large tasks that may need decomposition. If omitted, the orchestrator infers effort from acceptance criteria count and `code_areas` breadth.

### Type Values (Per-feature only)

- `story` - User-facing feature or functionality
- `chore` - Technical work, refactoring, infrastructure
- `spike` - Research or exploration task

### Environment Values (`envs`)

The `envs` field tracks which environments a task targets and has been verified in. Valid values:

| Value | Meaning | When to use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `dev` | Development environment | Default for all tasks. Code is deployed and working in dev. |
| `staging` | Pre-production / UAT environment | Task has been promoted to staging and verified there. |
| `prod` | Production environment | Task is deployed to production and confirmed working. |

**How `envs` evolves during a task's lifecycle:**

```yaml
# Task starts — targeting dev
envs: [dev]
status: in_progress

# Feature verified in dev, promoted to staging
envs: [dev, staging]
status: in_progress

# Feature verified in all target environments
envs: [dev, staging, prod]
status: done
```

**Rules:**

- `defaults.envs` in the task file header sets the starting target for all tasks in the file — typically `[dev]`
- A task should not be marked `status: done` until it is verified in **all environments listed in its `envs` field**
- Environments are cumulative — a task deployed to `staging` should also list `dev` (it was verified there first)
- Tasks that only need dev verification (e.g., internal tooling, developer utilities) can have `envs: [dev]` and be marked `done` after dev verification alone
- Tasks targeting production must pass through environments in order: `dev` → `staging` → `prod`
- The `envs` field is informational by default — enforcement happens through the deployment workflow (see `templates/workflow/DEPLOYMENT_WORKFLOW.md`)

**Interaction with `status`:**

| `status` | `envs` implication |
|----------|-------------------|
| `todo` | `envs` indicates target environments (where the task *will* be deployed) |
| `in_progress` | `envs` indicates environments where the task has been verified so far |
| `blocked` | `envs` unchanged — task is waiting on a dependency |
| `done` | `envs` must include all target environments — verification is complete |

See `templates/workflow/DEPLOYMENT_WORKFLOW.md` for the full environment promotion process, deployment gates, and rollback procedures.

## 🤖 Multi-Agent Integration

### Agent Role Assignment

The `agent_roles` field indicates which agents should work on a task:

```yaml
- id: TASK_T1_example
  agent_roles:
    - implementation  # Implementation Agent handles business logic
    - ui_ux          # UI/UX Agent handles design
    - testing        # Testing Agent writes tests
```

### Workflow Patterns

**Sequential** (agents work one after another):
```yaml
agent_roles: [ui_ux, implementation, testing]
# UI/UX designs → Implementation builds → Testing tests
```

**Parallel** (agents work independently):
```yaml
# Task A
agent_roles: [implementation]

# Task B (separate)
agent_roles: [ui_ux]
```

**Review-based** (implementation + reviews):
```yaml
agent_roles: [implementation, quality_assurance, testing]
# Implementation builds → QA reviews → Testing tests
```

### Backlog Reference

The optional `backlog_ref` field links a task to a portfolio-level backlog item, milestone, or gap. This makes it easy for agents and tooling to trace tasks back to higher-level goals.

**Format**: A reference string pointing to the relevant backlog entry.

```yaml
backlog_ref: "docs/backlog.md#user-profiles"
```

```yaml
backlog_ref: "tasks.yml#user-profiles"
```

If your project uses `tasks.yml` milestones, reference the milestone ID directly. If you maintain a separate backlog document, use an anchor link or section reference.

### Agent Selection Guidelines

See `AGENTS.md` for detailed agent responsibilities and when to use each role.

---

## 📊 Task Dependencies

### Blocking Relationships

Use `blocked_by` and `blocks` to define task dependencies:

```yaml
- id: TASK_T1_foundation
  blocked_by: []     # No dependencies
  blocks:
    - TASK_T2_feature_a
    - TASK_T3_feature_b

- id: TASK_T2_feature_a
  blocked_by:
    - TASK_T1_foundation  # Must wait for T1
  blocks: []
```

### Dependency Rules

1. **No Circular Dependencies**: Task A cannot depend on Task B if B depends on A
2. **Cross-Feature Dependencies**: Use full task IDs (e.g., `FEATURE_A_T1`)
3. **Portfolio Dependencies**: Use milestone IDs in `dependencies` field

---

## ✅ Best Practices

### ID Naming Conventions

**Portfolio-level** (`tasks.yml`):
- Milestones: `lowercase-hyphenated` (e.g., `auth-system`, `user-profiles`)
- Gaps: `lowercase-hyphenated` (e.g., `missing-docs`, `performance-issue`)

**Per-feature** (`tasks/*.yml`):
- Tasks: `{FEATURE}_{T}{N}_{short_name}` (e.g., `PROFILE_T1_view_page`, `AUTH_T3_2fa`)

### Title Guidelines

- **Descriptive**: Clear what the task/milestone is about
- **Actionable**: Use verbs (Implement, Create, Fix, Add, Update)
- **Concise**: Keep under 80 characters
- **Specific**: Avoid vague terms like "improvements" or "enhancements"

### Description Guidelines

- **Context**: Why is this needed?
- **Details**: What specifically needs to be done?
- **Scope**: What's included and excluded?
- **References**: Link to relevant docs/specs

### Acceptance Criteria Guidelines

- **Testable**: Can be verified objectively
- **Specific**: Concrete outcomes, not vague goals
- **Complete**: Defines "done" completely
- **User-focused**: Written from user/system perspective

### Tag Guidelines

Use consistent tags for filtering and reporting:

- **By Type**: `feature`, `bug`, `refactor`, `docs`, `infra`
- **By Area**: `auth`, `profile`, `search`, `payments`, etc.
- **By Concern**: `performance`, `security`, `accessibility`, `technical-debt`

## 🔄 Workflow Integration

### Task Selection

1. Open relevant feature task file (`tasks/*.yml`)
2. Find task with `status: todo` (prefer `priority: high`)
3. Check `agent_roles` field to verify your role matches
4. Read `spec_refs`, `description`, `acceptance_criteria`
5. Check `blocked_by` to ensure dependencies are met

### Status Updates

Propose status changes as you work:

```yaml
# Before starting
status: todo

# While working
status: in_progress

# If blocked
status: blocked

# When complete
status: done
```

### Completion Criteria

Mark task as `done` only when:
- All `acceptance_criteria` are met
- All `tests` are implemented and passing
- Code is reviewed (if `quality_assurance` agent involved)
- Documentation updated (if `documentation` agent involved)
- Task is verified in all target environments listed in `envs` (see Environment Values above)

## 🔗 Validation

### Manual Validation

Check your task files:

1. **Schema validity**: Ensure YAML is valid
2. **Required fields**: All required fields present
3. **ID uniqueness**: No duplicate task IDs
4. **Dependency validity**: All `blocked_by` tasks exist
5. **Agent roles**: All `agent_roles` values are valid

### Automated Validation (Optional)

Create a validation script:

```javascript
// scripts/validate-tasks.js
const yaml = require('js-yaml');
const fs = require('fs');

function validateTaskFile(filePath) {
  const content = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
  const data = yaml.load(content);
  
  // Validate required fields
  if (!data.epic || !data.feature || !data.tasks) {
    throw new Error(`Missing required fields in ${filePath}`);
  }
  
  // Validate task IDs
  const ids = new Set();
  for (const task of data.tasks) {
    if (ids.has(task.id)) {
      throw new Error(`Duplicate task ID: ${task.id}`);
    }
    ids.add(task.id);
  }
  
  console.log(`✓ ${filePath} is valid`);
}
```
