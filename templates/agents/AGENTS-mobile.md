## 🔄 Agent Collaboration Patterns

### Sequential Workflow (Recommended for New Features)

**Use Case**: New feature requiring UI, business logic, and tests

**Workflow**:
1. **UI/UX Agent** → Design review, component planning, Figma alignment
2. **Implementation Agent** → Implement business logic and integrate UI
3. **Testing Agent** → Write tests (unit, widget, integration)
4. **UI/UX Agent** → Final design polish and accessibility review

**Example Task**:
```yaml
- id: FEATURE_T1_user_profile
  title: "Implement user profile page"
  agent_roles: [ui_ux, implementation, testing]
  description: >
    Full feature: design review → implementation → tests → polish
```

### Parallel Workflow (For Independent Work)

**Workflow**:
- **Implementation Agent** → Works on backend/service logic (Task A)
- **UI/UX Agent** → Works on UI components independently (Task B)
- **Testing Agent** → Creates tests for previously completed feature (Task C)

### Review Workflow (Quality Assurance)

**Workflow**:
1. **Implementation Agent** → Implements feature
2. **UI/UX Agent** → Reviews UI consistency and design alignment
3. **Testing Agent** → Reviews test coverage and creates missing tests

## 📋 Task Integration

### Mobile-Specific Task Fields

```yaml
tasks:
  - id: MOBILE_T1_example
    title: "Implement profile screen"
    type: story
    status: todo
    priority: high
    agent_roles:
      - implementation  # Business logic, state management
      - ui_ux          # UI design, accessibility
      - testing        # Unit, widget, integration tests
    spec_refs:
      - "PDB: docs/product_design/{{PROJECT_NAME}}_pdb.md — Profile section"
      - "Design: Figma link or design doc"
    description: >
      Implement user profile screen with edit capabilities.
    code_areas:
      - "lib/features/profile/presentation/pages/"
      - "lib/features/profile/data/services/" # if Clean Architecture
    acceptance_criteria:
      - "User can view and edit profile"
      - "Changes save to {{BACKEND}}"
      - "UI follows design system"
      - "Tests cover happy path and errors"
      - "Works on iOS and Android"
    # ... other fields
```

### Role Mapping

Task files use short `agent_roles` values. This table maps each value to the role (and checklist) the agent should adopt:

| `agent_roles` value | Role to adopt | Notes |
|----------------------|---------------|-------|
| `implementation` | Implementation Agent | Business logic, services, state management |
| `ui_ux` | UI/UX Agent | Design system, accessibility, visual consistency |
| `testing` | Testing Agent | Unit, widget, and integration tests |
| `quality_assurance` | UI/UX Agent | Code review — apply QA lens with UI/UX Agent's design review checklist |
| `documentation` | Implementation Agent | Documentation — apply docs lens to code and features |
| `frontend` | UI/UX Agent | Frontend-scoped — use UI/UX Agent checklist |
| `backend` | Implementation Agent | Backend-scoped — use Implementation Agent checklist |
| `security` | Implementation Agent | Security focus — apply security lens to auth, data handling |

If a task lists a value not in this table, treat it as Implementation Agent.

## 📋 Task Execution Protocol

When you pick up a task with multiple `agent_roles`, follow this protocol:

1. **Read the task** — review `agent_roles`, `spec_refs`, `description`, and `acceptance_criteria`
2. **Resolve roles** — map each `agent_roles` value to a role using the Role Mapping table above
3. **Execute in order** — work through the roles in the order they are listed in `agent_roles`
4. **Per role** — complete that role's checklist, then add a handoff note to the task before moving to the next role
5. **Final role** — after completing the last role's work, validate all `acceptance_criteria` and propose `status: done`
6. **Single role** — if only one role is listed, complete its checklist and propose status when done

## 🔌 Plugins and MCP Tools

Agents have access to MCP tools and skills provided by installed Cursor plugins. See `docs/CURSOR_PLUGINS.md` for the full list. Use them when relevant to the task.

**Stack-relevant examples**:
- **Context7**: Look up current docs for {{FRAMEWORK}} and mobile dependencies before implementing unfamiliar APIs
- **BrowserStack App Automate**: Test on real devices across iOS and Android
- **Figma skills**: Translate Figma mockups to mobile UI components with 1:1 fidelity
- **parallel-web-search**: Verify best practices for mobile patterns, accessibility, or platform-specific behavior

Flag gaps: if agents are doing work manually that a plugin, skill, or MCP server could handle, recommend installing or creating one and update `docs/CURSOR_PLUGINS.md`.

## 💡 Mobile Development Tips

### For Implementation Agent
- **Architecture Decision**: Use Clean Architecture for complex features with multiple data sources; use Presentation-Only for simple UI-focused features
- **State Management**: Follow {{STATE_MANAGEMENT}} patterns from existing features
- **Core Services**: Reuse services from `lib/core/auth/`, `lib/core/media/`, etc.
- **Platform Differences**: Handle iOS/Android differences gracefully

### For UI/UX Agent
- **Design System First**: Always check `lib/core/theme/` and `lib/design_system/` before creating custom widgets
- **Theme Tokens Only**: Never use magic numbers for colors, spacing, or dimensions
- **Accessibility**: Test with screen readers, check contrast, ensure hit targets are 44x44dp minimum
- **Responsive**: Test on phones and tablets, both orientations

### For Testing Agent
- **Test Pyramid**: More unit tests, fewer widget tests, even fewer integration tests
- **Mock External Services**: Mock Firebase, APIs, and platform-specific code
- **Real Devices**: Test on real devices for final validation
- **Performance**: Monitor memory usage and app performance in tests
